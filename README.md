This application was created in the context of a class project, at the IUT of Caen.



This PoMoDoRo app offers a simple way to manage your work/rest time management.

Contrarily to common belief, human attention span is quite short. As such, it is hard to stay focused on a single task for a long amount of time, even more so if it does not interests you.

This application offers a solution to this issue.

By managing your work and rest on a strict timer, you can save stamina and improve productivity.
