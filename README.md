# Pomodoro

[link to the application](https://mehliug-sg.github.io/Pomodoro/)



This application was created in the context of a class project, at the IUT of Caen.



This PoMoDoRo app offers a simple way to manage your work/rest time management.

Contrarily to common belief, human attention span is quite short. As such, it is hard to stay focused on a single task for a long amount of time, even more so if it does not interests you.

This application offers a solution to this issue.

By managing your work and rest on a strict timer, you can save stamina and improve productivity.


##Features

Upon entering the website, you are confronted with the timer, set at 0.

At this moment you can :

-Start the timer with the default time (25 mn for work, 5 mn for rest)
-Modify the time you will work
-Modify the time you will rest

Once you launch the timer, you cannot pause it. However, you can reset it.

Once the timer is launched, you can :

-Reset the timer. The next time you launch it, it will start back at the beginning of the work cycle.
-Change the time you will work. Modifications will only apply at the beginning of the next work cycle.
-Change the time you will rest. Modifications will only apply at the beginning of the next work cycle.
